**Data Ingestion and Transformation**: The first step involved ingesting the TLC Trip Record Data, which is a comprehensive dataset of Uber trips. The Mage Data Pipeline Tool, a powerful tool for data ingestion and transformation, was used to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. This step is crucial for removing any noise or irrelevant information from the data and converting it into a format suitable for analysis.

**Advanced Analytics**: After the data was prepared, it was analyzed using BigQuery, a web service from Google that is used for handling and analyzing big data. BigQuery allows for fast SQL queries against large datasets. Python was also used for performing some advanced analytics on the data.

**Data Visualization**: Looker Studio, a data exploration and visualization tool, was used to create visualizations of the insights derived from the analysis. Visualizations help in understanding the data better and in identifying patterns and trends that might not be apparent from the raw data.

**Strategic Decision-Making**: The ultimate goal of the project was to aid in strategic decision-making by identifying key operational trends and patterns in Uber's trip data. The insights derived from the analysis and visualizations helped in understanding the operational efficiency of Uber, areas that need improvement, and potential opportunities for growth.

Overall, the project demonstrated skills in data ingestion and transformation, advanced analytics, data visualization, and strategic decision-making. It showcased the ability to handle and analyze large datasets, derive meaningful insights from them, and use those insights to make informed strategic decisions.
